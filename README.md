Semester Plan, this will give a breakdown and keep track of the work needed to be complete by the end of the semester indicating how long I shold indulge on the work, due dates, milestones, status of the task and etc.

Each project will have it's own repository whereby as time progresses and changes being made to each repo, I will have to pull each repo to integrate and make it one, but I will have to update my repos with every project.
 
Proejcts can automatically build and validate every pull request and commit to your GitHub repository. This article describes how to configure the integration between GitHub and projects.

The branching strategy to be used will be the Gitflow, it isolates your work into different types of branches which makes it easy and intuitive to organize your work. It also allows you to easily and continuously support multiple versions of production code. The two primary branches in Git flow are main and develop. There are three types of supporting branches with different intended purposes: feature, release, and hotfix.
